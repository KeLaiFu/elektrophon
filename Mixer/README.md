# Mixer

When you start building your modular synthesizer you could mix the audio signals with some resistors 
as a passive mixer. but soon you will need a mixer for your modules. This is a very simple mixer with 4 channels.
The mixer is build with TL072 OPAMP. Both stages of the opamp are setup as an inverting amplifier. There is 
also a LED driver for disaplying the activity on the fromt panel.
