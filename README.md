# elektrophon
collection of modules for a modular analog electro acoustic noise machine. all modules are built on protoboards and with 3d printed front plates.

# before you start
i recommend building the breadboard syntesizers on hackaday by elliot williams. this is a very good introduction to the lunetta spririt of building synthesizers. ---

# modules and racks



the sizes for modular synths are mostly equal to the standard size for electronic and computer racks. the rails and racks for synthesizers are very expensive, but the parts can also be ordered from electronic vendors. The horizontal Rails from the electronic vendor are a bit cheaper (i.e. [farnel](https://de.farnell.com/schroff/34560-484/horizontal-rail-enclosure/dp/2816357).

## Voltage Controller Oszilators 
Voltage Controlled Oscillator, a continuous voltage source, which will output a signal whose frequency is a function of the settings. In its basic form these may be simple waveforms (most usually a square wave or a sawtooth wave, but also includes pulse, triangle and sine waves), however these can be dynamically changed through such controls as sync, frequency modulation, and self-modulation.

# general electronic and synthesizer information 

Here are some links do documents on how to build synthesizers and electronic. the logic noise serie on hackaday are a very good start and does not require in depth electronic knowledge. read the other documents when you think you should know more about a specific topic.

* [LOGIC NOISE: SWEET, SWEET OSCILLATOR SOUNDS by: Elliot Williams](https://hackaday.com/2015/02/04/logic-noise-sweet-sweet-oscillator-sounds/) hackaday article series for building the basic synthesizer parts with cmos chips.
