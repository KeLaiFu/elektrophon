# elektrophon
collection of modules for a modular analog electro acoustic noise machine. all modules are built on stripboards or pcb's and with 3d printed front plates.The goal is it to build the modules quickly. The 3d printed front panels comes complete with holes and stands. This makes it easy to mount the module. The modules can be mount to a rack. <a href="https://spielhuus.github.io/elektrophon/fly_rack.jpg"><img align="right" src="https://spielhuus.github.io/elektrophon/fly_rack_tmb.jpg"></a>  The first rack i built was a small testing rack, the fly rack.There are only two side panels to print. For the rails i used the standard euro panel rails from the electronic vendors (i.e. [farnel](https://de.farnell.com/schroff/34560-484/horizontal-rail-enclosure/dp/2816357)). Every thing from the music stores is very expensive. it is a little bit cheaper to buy those rails. The sizes for modular synths are mostly equal to the standard size for electronic and computer racks.


# module size

The armatures, plugs and knobs, are placed in a fix raster. for the columns used for the module the resulting panel sizes are:

|HU|Armature Rows|Total Height [mm]|Total Width [mm]|PCB Width|PCB Height|
|--|-------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|----------|
|10|2            |133.35           |50.7|44.7|107.35|
|12|2 1/2        |133.35           |60.84|54.84|107.35|
|14|3            |133.35           |70.98|64.98|107.35|
|18|4            |133.35           |91.26|85.26|107.35|

# general electronic and synthesizer information 

Here are some links do documents on how to build synthesizers and electronic. the logic noise serie on hackaday are a very good start and does not require in depth electronic knowledge. read the other documents when you think you should know more about a specific topic. 

* [Rod Elliott (ESP) - The Audio Pages](http://sound.whsites.net/articles.htm#feat)
* [LOGIC NOISE: SWEET, SWEET OSCILLATOR SOUNDS by: Elliot Williams](https://hackaday.com/2015/02/04/logic-noise-sweet-sweet-oscillator-sounds/) hackaday article series for building the basic synthesizer parts with cmos chips.

* [UNDERSTANDING DIGITAL BUFFER, GATE, AND LOGIC IC CIRCUITS]() NUTS & VOLTS article series that describes the concept and application of logic ic citcuits.
