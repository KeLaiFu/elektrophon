# elektrophon
collection of modules for a modular analog electro acoustic noise machine. all modules are built on protoboards and with 3d printed front plates.

# before you start
i recommend building the breadboard syntesizers on hackaday by elliot williams. this is a very good introduction to the lunetta spririt of building synthesizers. ---

## Voltage Controller Oszilators 
Voltage Controlled Oscillator, a continuous voltage source, which will output a signal whose frequency is a function of the settings. In its basic form these may be simple waveforms (most usually a square wave or a sawtooth wave, but also includes pulse, triangle and sine waves), however these can be dynamically changed through such controls as sync, frequency modulation, and self-modulation.
