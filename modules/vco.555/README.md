## *vco*

The CEM3340 is used in many snyths using different designs [[3]]. Now that the chip is reissued i wanted to build an oszillator with it. This VCO is based on the VCO Maximus from Thomas Henry [[4]]. But without the suboszillator circuitry to keep the panel small. The CEM3340 makes building not as easy as it could. The chip outputs only positive signals and every signal has a different voltage. All the outputs needs to be level shiftet and amplified to the correct level [[5]]. Also for more stability voltage regulators for the power rails would be needed. I ommit those to keep the circuit simpler. The VCO has all the waveforms and functions a basic oszillator needs.
