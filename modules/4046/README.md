 # VCO: X4046

 This is the outstanding CMOS VCO from Thomas Henry. The heart of this VCO is the CD4046 Phased Locked Loop chip. 
Most of the 'Lunetta' VCOs are built around the 40106 or 4096 chips. They give a good result but this VCO plays in another league. It has an excellent tracking and all the 
waveforms you will need. The sync is one of the finest. Most of the sections are the same as in other VCO designs from Thomas Henry. The Exponential converter
and waveshaper sections are also used in the VCO-1. The only downside is that it gets a little pricy with all the trimpots and potentiomenters. The CD4046 shall not be from Texas Instruments, because it is reported that this one is hard or impossible to tune. This is a pitty, becase this is the easyiest to get. You can get almost every other part. I used the Phillips HEF4046, i like it to use a chip with the Phillips logo on it, i remember that logo from my childhood. Nevertheless, in my opinion it is worth 
the money and effort and you should build more than one of this fantastic VCO.

## calibration

The different waveforms are combined out of different parts and you will have to combine those by calibrating the VCO. I recommend doing that with an oszilloscope.

Connect your scope to the triangle wave output. Bring the oscillator to 1kHz with the coarse and fine adjustments. then you can calibrate the triangle wave. 
As you can see in the scope there is a falling and raising slope. use the two triangle connect trimpots (TC1/2) to bring them together.
