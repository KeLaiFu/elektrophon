    "people seem to love the russian polivoks synthesizer [[6][6]]. for me the most interesting thing is the filter section. it is built without any capacitors, instead it uses some weird russian opamps (KR140UD12). these are programmable opamps. with a control voltage the gain can be changed. this filter want to scream and can give percusive feedback responses, but can be well controlled. this filter is invented by vladimir kuzmin[[5][5]]. it has a lowpas and bandpass sections. instead of the original russion opamp also the western counterparts can be used (uA776, MC1776, LM4250,NTE888). of course none of these parts is available anymore. i got some LM4250 from china. beside the programmable opamp this filter is a very simple build. no calibration trimmers or accurate tempco stages required.<br/><br>\n",
